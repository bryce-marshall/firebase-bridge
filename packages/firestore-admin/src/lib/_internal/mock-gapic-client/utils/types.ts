 *
 * Notes
 * - Firestore does not store `undefined`. If `undefined` reaches the engine (from JS),
 *   it is classified as {@link EvalDataType.Undefined}. Operator logic should decide
 *   whether to treat it like "missing".
 * - `NumberNaN` is separated for predicate semantics (excluded from ranges; `==` only to itself)
 *   but maps to the numeric order bucket for sorting.
 * - Arrays/Maps require deep-equality for `==` and element equality for array ops.
 * - Reference equality requires same database; carry a `refDbKey` (or similar) outside this enum.
